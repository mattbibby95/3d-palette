# 3d-palette

This is a little test of ThreeJS.

I wanted to create something to view colour palettes on 3D models, you can use the buttons on the right to change colours of the materials applied to the model.

## Running

You'd need some way to serve the content such as a simple Express server or something. Other than that it should be good to go as most of the ThreeJS JS is imported from CDNs.

I've hosted it on an s3 bucket here: https://3dpalettethreejs.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/firstscene.html for as long as it doesn't cost me too much money ðŸ˜ƒ
